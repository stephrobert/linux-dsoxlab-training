## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, report it privately:

- Preferred: open a
  [private security advisory](https://github.com/stephrobert/linux-dsoxlab-training/security/advisories/new)
  on GitHub.
- Alternatively, use the contact details published at
  <https://blog.stephane-robert.info>.

Please include:

- a description of the vulnerability and its impact,
- the steps to reproduce it (command, environment, `dsoxlab --version`),
- any relevant logs or proof of concept.

We will acknowledge your report as soon as possible, keep you informed about the
progress toward a fix, and credit you in the release notes if you wish.

## Scope

This repository ships **lab content** (scenarios, tests, setup/cleanup and
provisioning fixtures, SSH public keys) executed by the external `dsoxlab` CLI.
In scope: unsafe or malicious lab material (setup/cleanup, tests,
Terraform/cloud-init templates), leaked secrets, or a private key committed by
mistake. Vulnerabilities in the `dsoxlab` engine itself belong to
[its own repository](https://github.com/stephrobert/dsoxlab); third-party
dependency issues should be reported to their respective projects.
